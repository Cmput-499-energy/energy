This directory contains an implementation of the algorithms and data
for Section 4 of the paper, "Approximate Inference in Additive
Factorial HMMs".  The experiments.m generates file the four graphs
included in the section.

The code makes use of the following packages (available separately):
- CPLEX (available free for academic use):
